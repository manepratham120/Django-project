Django is a powerful and popular web framework written in Python. It provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications quickly and efficiently. With Django, 
developers can focus on writing their application's logic and features, while Django takes care of many of the common web development tasks, such as URL routing, database management
and user authentication.

Building a to-do list application is just one example of what you can accomplish with Django. The framework offers a wide range of features, such as support for multiple databases,
a powerful admin interface, caching mechanisms, and internationalization capabilities.
